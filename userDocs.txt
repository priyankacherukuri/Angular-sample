The Application is using following Npm packages:

1. Prerender.io: 


This is the middleware to provide crawler with the Application in case it is created using Javascript framework where entire page is not remndered at once.

To add prerender to the application, simple add a middleware using "app.use". Middle ware shall cache the page in "Prerender.io". When a crawler request is recieved. It observes a "fragment" meta tag in head of the Application which will guide crawler to look for the cached page in Prerender.io.

To look for the Cached version simply append "/?_escaped_fragment_=" to the Page URL.

2. PM2:

run "npm install -g pm2" for the application
